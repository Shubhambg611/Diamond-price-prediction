Use __init__ file in every folder. Because when we create our own package then in it file will indicate the package. 
For example, there is one folder under At folder, there is file with that file. We will write __init __that will show that this is a part of the package. 
Inside that package there will be another folder which also include the __init __ file This all include makes one package which is local package 




To instal local package in local environment:-
1. pip install .pcakge name
2. in requirement.txt file 
		- pip insatll -e requirement.txt
